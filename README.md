# Fast-Math-React-Game
Fast Math is a simple, reaction-based game designed to test and improve your mental arithmetic skills under time pressure. The game's objective is to quickly solve basic math problems, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, within a limited timeframe. Typically, these problems are elementary, but the challenge lies in answering them quickly and accurately.

## Here's how the game generally works:
  - <b>Math Problem Displayed:</b> A simple math problem (e.g., 7 + 3 or 12 รท 4) is displayed on the screen.
  - <b>Time Limit:</b>  You have a very short time, often just a few seconds, to solve the problem.
  - <b>Input Answer:</b>  You must input the correct answer before the time runs out.
  - <b>Score:</b>  You earn points for each correct answer, and the game continues to present new problems, usually with increasing difficulty or shorter time limits.
  - <b>Game Over:</b>  The game ends when you fail to answer a problem within the time limit or if you provide an incorrect answer.
    
The primary purpose of Fast Math games is to sharpen mental math skills, enhance cognitive speed, and provide a fun and competitive way to practice basic arithmetic. They are popular in educational settings and as casual games on various platforms, including websites, mobile apps, and educational tools.
